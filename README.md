# Rock My Recipe!
🥦🧅🥒🌶️🥗🫐🍇🥬🧄🥙🥝🧆🍉🥑🌽

This is a *#TechForGood* recipe sharing web app being built using Ruby on Rails. You can follow the build progress on [twitter](https://twitter.com/rockmyrecipe).

## Aims of the project

The ultimate aim of the project is to be a fundraising and promotional tool for charities/non-profit organisations. At present you can share your recipes, like and comment on other's recipes and use your profile to promote your cause.

### For Developers

When Rock My Recipe reaches Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage I'll update this file with more info including full instructions for how to use and contribute to it (ruby version, system dependencies) etc. For now the database schema is changing regularly and there are plenty of known bugs to be ironed out. If you're looking for some good 'First Issues' as a junior developer feel free to Star and check back in later 🙌 

If you have a strong and immediate desire to use my code for your own projects before the MVP is ready you are within your rights to do so **BUT PLEASE don't do so anonymously: FORK it** and send me a personal **message** about how you'll **use it in line with it's *#TechForGood* aims.** 😇 🤝 👍

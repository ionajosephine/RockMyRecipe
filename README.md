# Rock My Recipe!
🥦🧅🥒🌶️🥗🫐🍇🥬🧄🥙🥝🧆🍉🥑🌽

This is a *#TechForGood* recipe sharing web app being built using Ruby on Rails. You can view its current state live: [Rock My Recipe](https://www.rockmyrecipe.com) and if you do so you will see it is still in the early stages of development! You can follow the build progress on [twitter](https://twitter.com/rockmyrecipe).

## Aims of the project

The ultimate aim of the project is to be a fundraising and promotional tool for charities/non-profit organisations. 

I have many ideas for how the final product *could* be. Although I'm following my plan for the general shape of the project I'm also allowing the build to evolve naturally, enjoying the creative process and learning as I go along. So in the end it will be a surprise! 🤪

### For Developers

When Rock My Recipe reaches Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage I'll update this file with more info including instructions for how to use it, ruby version, system dependencies, configuration, etc. For now the database schema is changing every week and it has plenty of bugs!

If you have a strong and immediate desire to use my code for your own projects before the MVP is ready 🤨 you are within your rights to do so **BUT PLEASE don't do so anonymously: FORK it** and send me a personal **message** about how you'll **use it in line with it's *#TechForGood* aims.** 😇 🤝 👍

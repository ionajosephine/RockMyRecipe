<p>
Rock My Recipe is licenced open source software being built by <a href="https://ionameadows.com" class="text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600">Iona Meadows</a>.
You can see the source code on <a href="https://github.com/ionajosephine/recipeshare" class="text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600">Github</a>. 
The site is still under construction and you can follow the build progress on <a href="https://twitter.com/rockmyrecipe" class="text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600">Twitter</a>.
I wouldn't recommend trying any of the recipes just yet as they are all just dummy text at the moment!
However when the project is complete you will be able to sign up and contribute recipes yourself! More information will be added to this page as the project progresses.

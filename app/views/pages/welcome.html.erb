Rock My Recipe is licenced open source software being built by <a href="https://ionameadows.com" class="text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600">Iona Meadows</a>.<br><br>

You can see the source code on <a href="https://github.com/ionajosephine/recipeshare" class="text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600">Github</a>. <br><br>

The site is still under construction and you can follow the build progress on <a href="https://twitter.com/rockmyrecipe" class="text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600">Twitter</a>.<br><br>

The aim of the project is for this platform to be a fundraising and promotional tool for small charities or non-profits.<br><br>

I wouldn't recommend trying any of the recipes just yet as they are all just dummy text at the moment! 😎 <br>
Equally if you sign up you won't get confirmation emails and any recipes you add will be lost when the database gets reset. 😁  <br><br>

However when the project is complete you will be able to sign up and contribute recipes yourself! 🤩 <br><br>

More information will be added to this page as the project progresses.<br><br>

Thanks for popping by! 🥦🥑🧅🥗🥒🌶️
